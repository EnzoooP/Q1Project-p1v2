                    <p><b>Question #1:  What is the site's purpose?</b>
                        <br>This site is used by users to share their memorable stories. This site wants for people that are troubled to see these stories and make them feel better. They can also share their own stories to other people with maximum anonimity.

                    <p><b>Question #2:  Is there censorship in stories?</b>
                        <br>Yes, I will manually review stories. I will block stories that may contain blatantly racist, manipulative, and hurtful due to them conflicting with the goals of the website. Swear words used in a non-diminishing way are allowed by the website.

                    <p><b>Question #3:  What is the difference of this site with other similar sites?</b>
                        <br>This site's goal is to provide internet users with a place to post their experiences. It also has a goal to better the mental health of its users. I want the users to express themselves, to not be afraid to open up, and to always observe freedom expression(Although derogotory, racist, and manipulative remarks are not-allowed)
                    </p>      lets you bookmark stories that you like

                    <p><b>Question #4:  How do I set-up my account?</b>
                        <br>My plan for this website is to allow people to share their stories anonymously. With that, whenever a new person registers, then he or she will be assigned a username in this format: "User ####". With your account, you can go to your account page set-up your automatic blacklister and favorites bar. An automatic blacklister lets you automatically block tags whenever you login to your account. A favourites bar lets you bookmark stories that you like for future references.

                    <p><b>Question #5:  Can I make a new account?</b>
                        <br>No, I will try to limit the number of accounts a person can make because it may be used in a non-savory way. Such as harassment or bullying of other users. Though I will try my best to ban/prohibit bullying in taking place.

                    <p><b>Question #6:  Can I delete posted stories?</b>
                        <br>Yes, stories may be hard to share and it is highly encouraged to express oneself, but it is always fine to not let personal matters go public.

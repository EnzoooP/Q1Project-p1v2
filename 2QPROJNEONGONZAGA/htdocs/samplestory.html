            Hopeful is the feeling that we all had at the beginning of this new century. We all thought that "2019 was the worst year ever. It couldn't possibly be worse, right?". No, it became worse. Starting with an immediate threat of WW3 between the US and Iran and, now here we are, confined in our homes, the threat of a worldwide pandemic, and enduring communication and internet problems with online classes. What is a better icing on the cake than WW3 itself, right? To end this year with a bang, or so they say. In all actuality, I am horrified, scared for my life, for my family. The thought of everything being taken away in an instant is utterly depressing. With this, in my opinion, the use of a nuke is a decimation of innocent lives and priceless objects for the hope of eradicating a conflicting opinion or idea stemming from the acquired selfishness, greed, and ignorance of man. Regarding this, we will now explore the possible locations where we could detonate all the bombs in the world.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, we could try to bomb the ocean. "Detonating a bomb in the ocean? Wouldn't that cause mass fish death?" Yes, and my justification for that is, although the underwater ecosystem will become eradicated, we can now get rid of the bombs that are plaguing humanity. In an article by Popular Mechanics coupled with a video by Kurgesagt, a science YouTuber, they wrote that if Tsar Bomba, USSR bomb, was exploded inside the Mariana Trench, the deepest sea cave ever discovered: "The darkest place on earth suddenly sees the brightest light as the nuclear chain reaction unleashes an incredible amount of energy. The fireball would expand to about a kilometer in diameter...and then pretty much petered out."(Though the tsunami caused will affect surrounding countries, for example, the Philippines) If we detonate every nuke in the world, which amounts to 13,410 warheads (Kirtensen & Korda, 2020), it will probably disrupt the Earth's normal processes and even cause a worldwide tsunami enveloping every landmass known and unknown to man.  
            <br><br>
            If you do not like the idea of dying to a tsunami, then look no further than the destruction of the internet. "What happens if you detonated a bomb high in the clouds?" This is what some smart people thought when they detonated a 1.4 megaton bomb 400km above the surface of Earth in 1962. This caused an EMP so strong that it took out Hawaii's lights, navigation systems, and even so far as to affect satellites that were about 36,000 kilometers from the Earth's surface. Many nukes similar to the explosion power of the Tsar-Bomba will result in not only electricity and the internet being destroyed but also radiation particles in the atmosphere will travel throughout the globe. In space though, it's a different story. Without the presence of the atmosphere, there would not be an explosion. Though with this, we will need to somehow accommodate thousands of bombs, weighing 1.1 metric tons, to put in space. 
            <br><br>
            What if we bomb a city? The country affected will understand because our cause will be for the greater good. Thanks to NUKEMAP, we can see the effects of it. If you detonate a bomb the scale of Tsar-Bomba directly in Manila with the Amihan winds influencing the radiation particles, then there will have an estimated 12,648,640 deaths and 5,496,800 injured.  Palawan will be covered with radiational fallout and will even influence 20-30% of Malaysia. Compared with the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the difference between the two death tolls is about 12,460,000 deaths in favor of the bomb in Manila. If we detonate every single bomb in Manila is hard to estimate due to limitations of intelligence and the NUKEMAP site, but, according to PopularMechanics once again, it can be estimated that the World's supply of bombs will be equal to 10-Krakatoa eruptions. This will amount to 20 Tsar Bomba explosions. Effectively wiping off any city and even cities that are at least 31 miles around it. Causing a shockwave flattening 1,864 square miles of land from the point of impact. This explosion is 25 times as large as the original Tsar-Bomba explosion.
            <br><br>
            It appears there are so many good places where people could detonate bombs into. The possibilities are endless, but alas, detonating them all in  one place might not seem fair for the other places, so if we detonate all the bombs into the whole country then it will be equal. While we are at it, what if we detonate all the bombs equally to the whole world.  This would simultaneously help our bomb problem and even promote equality and unbiased decisions.
            <br><br>
            Before you bomb things though, you should sell some clothes, objects, and shelters that are bomb-proof to make money from the overly cautious people. You could even make some bomb threats to scare the people into buying your product. To avoid unneeded casualties, we could force the poor or the people that are incapable of protecting themselves into slavery whom you are the owner of and have the power to sell the slaves to other countries. Further increasing your profit. "What about the people's properties and possessions?" and my answer to that is it that it will be bombed anyway so it will be fine.
            <br><br>
            To summarize, to way get rid of all bombs, promote good character, and ensure maximum profit is to bomb every city equally, save from your own of course, and establish a slave industry for those poor enough to not afford the product (pass) because the poor people were going to die anyways so at least they still can live. To reiterate, the use of bombs is unjustifiable in any means and that is with should be discarded.

                <li>Amazing take, though I have conflicting opinions.</li>
                <li>I like the discourse using a satirical form to emphasize the absurdity of nuclear weapons. Nice</li>
                <li>Where is the TL;DR?</li>
                <li>I agree with the premise tho the grammar seems faulty to say the least. lol</li>
